Final Project for CS 382

Do not do the WebGL it dose not load the ui elements needed. It also refuses to have the peroper camrea angle. I suggest you load the project up in unity  and hit play (after make sure the scene is correct).

I do not know if its the legacy text/ buttons causing this issue all I do know its annoying. Also make sure you say no to the pop up about legancy controls.

WASD is the control sceme. You can upgrade you speed for a givem amount of resources, you can reset your play area to get more score for more speed.
